### 2. 介词 + 关系代词
#### 2.1 单个介词+关系代词(whom, which)

介词确定的依据

- 根据从句中的动词、形容词或名词与介词的固定搭配而定

  - There were two <font color = "red">possessions(财产)</font> of the James and Jack <u>of which</u> they took great pride.
    
    此处which指代前面的possessions，故最合适的介词是of
  - We must find the person <u>in whom</u> we have confidence. 
    
    此处指代person，故选用whom

- 依照先行词与从句中动词的关系以及所表达的含义而定
  - A good ad often uses words <u>to which</u> people attach positive meanings.

    从句意为人们附上积极的意义，所修饰的词为words，故选用to which，表将意义添加到words中

  - Have you found the <font color = "red">cave(山洞)</font> <u>in which</u> the bear is <font color = "red">hibernating(冬眠)</font>?
